```{r Cleaning data}
plastics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/plastics.csv')


plastics_new <- plastics %>% 
  select("country", "hdpe", "ldpe", "o", "pet", "pp", "ps", "pvc",
         "grand_total")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
